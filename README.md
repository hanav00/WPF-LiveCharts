## Introduction

The Gym Discount Price Comparison project aims to help me easily compare discount prices offered by different gyms. 
By visualizing the data in a chart, I can quickly identify the best deals available.

## Background

I understand the importance of exercise, but I don't enjoy it ðŸ˜….
To justify not registering at a gym, I wanted to show that the current prices are too expensive. 
I used Chart to organize the data in an easy-to-view format. 
Since this is a simple view-only application, I did not design a database.

## Features

- Implemented the desired chart using the LiveCharts.WPF library.
- Visual comparison of gym discount prices using LiveCharts.
- Simple and intuitive user interface built with .NET WPF.
- Ability to add, update, and remove gym price data.
